# DriverPass-Business-Requirements-and-System-Design-Documents

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  DriverPass is a online driver training school that is looking to implement and expand their influence within the marketplace. They intend to do this by making an online site for their students to take tests, schedule driver training, get feedback about their drives, and practice test taking through individualized profiles. 

What did you do particularly well?

  I believe that the portion I did very well was the development of the Business requirements. I felt that I was able to find what the customer wanted, determine the functional and non functional requirements, come up with some unique solutions to the problem posed, and implement a highly secure way to execute this.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The portion of this assignment that I would like to revise would be the system design document. I believe that while my system designs were correct, they could have been more in-depth. I find that this was the most difficult portion of the assignment, to correctly identify all elements of the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The way that I interpreted the clients needs was through the business requirements document. It was really great to have an outline of items that we wanted to address, and this forced me to look deeper into the clients requirements. It is extremely important to know the clients needs so that the best application/system can be developed. Without having an idea about the full list of needs and ways of implementation, we would be stuck in a limbo of creating systems that the client would not accept.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  The way that I approach designing software is to first make sure that all requirements of the product are met. It is important that the requirements of a project are met by the code that is written. I then like to validate this through testing and making sure that the code is efficient. Fast and efficient code pushes it through testing and later implementation faster so that it meets the cost constraints of the project. I personally would like to implement both Business Requirements documents and system design documents to fully understand the clients needs and how to implement these into the design.
